# PADRE - UAV_measurement_data

The repository contains sensory data from drones collected during flights with different types of propeller failures. Measurements from accelerometers, gyroscopes, microphones and other sensors were collected during flights with different types of failures occurring in various configurations in one, two, three or four rotors. Raw sensor output, preprocessed data and digitally processed signals have been made available. The shared repository should be helpful in developing methods for detecting and classifying defects in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) actuators. It will be particularly useful for researchers working on data-driven methods. The default purpose of the dataset is to train artificial intelligence models that require large amounts of data.

The names of the main directories indicate the construction of the UAV from which the data was collected. The subsequent folders include Readme.txt files detailing the contents of each folder.
